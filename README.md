### Project Description
[FoodBridge is a web platform that connects hotels with NGOs to reduce food waste and fight hunger.
Hotels can post details about leftover food, including quantity and freshness time.
NGOs can view and request available food, ensuring timely and efficient redistribution to those in need.]

### The Problem statement
[Many hotels waste surplus food daily, while NGOs struggle to provide meals to the needy. There is no efficient system to connect food donors with organizations in real time. FoodBridge aims to bridge this gap by enabling easy and timely redistribution of leftover food.]

### The Solution
[FoodBridge is a web platform that connects hotels and NGOs to redistribute surplus food efficiently. Hotels can post leftover food details, and NGOs can request it in real time to reduce waste and fight hunger.]
